            <p>The top reasons why people drink coffee are more than simply the caffeine content. While this would be
                the most obvious answer and the one that most people would think is the top reason, it is not the only
                reason. A steaming cup of coffee is the first thing millions of people reach for every morning and there
                are a multitude of reasons these people do so on a daily basis. Some of those reasons and why they are
                the top reasons are included here. Caffeine is the ingredient that most people who drink coffee indulge
                in their favorite beverage. The caffeine in it plays two roles in why people drink coffee. First, the
                caffeine in coffee helps to get people' blood moving and makes them feel energized. Third shift workers
                and early morning workers tend to rely on their coffee to help them get through their work day.

                This is one of the top reasons that many people drink coffee. The other reason caffeine is a reason that
                people drink coffee is that it is addictive. There are many chemicals in coffee that lend to its
                addictive properties and caffeine is the main one. Addiction is one of the top reasons people drink
                coffee every day. Caffeine withdrawal can cause headaches and irritability and many people prefer not to
                give up their coffee. If they happen to simply like the taste of coffee but want to avoid caffeine they
                can switch to decaffeinated and avoid the addiction</p>

                The global coffee and tea industry include ready-to-serve products, instant, and brewed ingredients, and
                any
                number of dedicated shops that serve the beverages exclusively or as part of their beverage service.
                According to Business Wire’s “Coffee and Tea Global Market Report, 2020-30: COVID-19 Impact and
                Recovery”
                report, the total coffee and tea market is predicted to grow from $142.1 billion in 2019 to $148.5
                billion
                in 2020, an annual growth rate of 4.6 percent.

                The rate is actually low because of the Coronavirus closings, but the industry should bounce back to an
                average growth rate of 9.0 percent yearly to reach $191.1 billion in 2023. Entrepreneurs in all coffee
                and
                tea service areas can plan proactively for business success by capitalizing on industry statistics and
