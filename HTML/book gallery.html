            <h3>Romeo and Juliet</h3>
            <p>Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by <strong>William Shakespeare</strong> early in his career about
                two
                young Italian
                star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. It was among Shakespeare's
                most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed
                plays. Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.</p>
